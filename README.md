######Document Type Declaration (DTD):
######The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration specifies that this document is an HTML5 document.
######It’s the first line of the HTML file and informs the browser about the document type.

######Inside the <html> element, we have two main sections: <head> and <body>.

It includes:
